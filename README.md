# Project-1-Stage-3

I am having a hard time with this error code, "Error: ooter__column-heading: Parse Error." Looks like this is the only error message or warning I am getting. I tried googling what this message means and it mainly pulls up as a typo somwhere along the css style sheet. I checked reviews style sheet several times and have no typos or double coding or anything like that. I also ran the code for html and css in a validator and no typos or incorrect spelling came back.  Not sure what this could be. Please review code, I greatly appreciate it. Thank you.
